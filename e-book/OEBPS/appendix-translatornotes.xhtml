	<p class="noindent top">Hello to all translators,</p>

	<p class="noindent top">First of all thanks for your overwhelming interest in translating the survival manual! I am writing this because I got a lot of requests and emails regarding the state of translations. From a distance, it sounds really easy – and for normal apps it sometimes is – but there are some special problems regarding translation with this specific app:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is text in images – this text has to be extracted so it can be translated. This also makes the app smaller! For a lot of list-style images like <a href="https://survivalmanual.github.io/fig08-04.png">https://survivalmanual.github.io/fig08-04.png</a> this is easy – but for images where text is embedded in drawings – this is more complicated.</li>
    <li>Currently, imperial measuring units (like miles / Fahrenheit) are used – Ideally, this should also be a translation vector.</li>
    <li>I imagine changes in the source language – there needs to be a way to keep them in sync (especially for lists).</li>
    <li>The text must be completely de-militarized before translating – I already did some of that but it is not yet complete.</li>
    <li>Having a lot of languages makes the app bigger (especially if there is a lot of text) – there need to be a way to deal with this (e.g. a language-apk split – or downloadable packs) – I do not want to waste space for a lot of languages I will never read.</li>
    <li>..</li>
  </ul>

	<p class="noindent top">These are the reasons I cannot just put the stuff in a translation management interface like Transifex and give a go for translators which I would usually do. If you see solutions to these problems please let me know. At some point I will give a go for translations – but I want to have a system where I have a way to deal with the problems I see – or at least see a way to deal with them in the future and having a way to keep translations in sync.</p>
