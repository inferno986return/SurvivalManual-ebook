<p><em>Q: Can you make this app work with the ultra power saving mode on samsung devices?</em></p>
<p>A: It does not seem to be possible. As far as I was able to find out - apps have to be white-listed from samsung. I have found no option to do this from the app-side. Would love to be able to do this - but it does not seem to be possible. If you know a way please let me know! Also if someone has contact to vendors like samsung - I also would love if this app gets preinstalled on new phones :-)</p>
<p><em>Q: I found a typo - do I have to live with it?</em></p>
<p>A: No - you are very invited to fix the typo or contribute other enhancements to the content via <a href="https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki">the wiki</a>.</p>
<p><em>Q: Can we please have translations?</em></p>
<p>A: Yes - but it’s complicated. You can read about this <a href="TranslatorNotes">here</a>. That said I will start with partial translation support ( some sections and in app translations ) soon and there are already a lot of translators standing by already ( thanks a lot for this ). But first the current content has to be improved more. It would be great help if people could break up the images with lists into markdown which is easier to translate and needs less space.</p>
<p><em>Q: It says offline - why does it still need internet permission?</em></p>
<p>A: The premise of “offline” here is that the app will work without internet in survival situations - but might still use the internet if it is available. If you do not want this you can still put your phone e.g. in airplane mode.</p>
<p><em>Q: Can you please not express any political opinions in this app?</em></p>
<p>A: No - I am not keeping my mouth shut for you - if you cannot take other opinions you should think about your own - maybe they are so fragile that you are afraid of others.</p>
