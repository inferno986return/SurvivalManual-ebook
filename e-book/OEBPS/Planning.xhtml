  <div class="greybox">
    <p class="noindent">Survival planning is nothing more than realizing something could happen that would put you in a survival situation and, with that in mind, taking steps to increase your chances of survival.</p>
  
    <p class="noindent top">Preparation means preparing yourself and your survival kit for those contingencies that you have in your plan. Prepare yourself by making sure your immunizations and dental work are up-to-date. Break in your boots and make sure that the boots have good soles and water-repellent properties. Study the area, climate, terrain, and indigenous methods of food and water procurement. You should continuously assess data, even after the plan is made, to update the plan as necessary and give you the greatest possible chance of survival. Another example of preparation is finding the emergency exits on an aircraft when you board it for a flight. <b>Practice things that you have planned with the items in your survival kit - get to know your gear. Checking ensures that items work and that you know how to use them.</b> Build a fire in the rain so you know that when it is critical to get warm, you can do it. Review the medical items in your kit and have instructions printed on their use so that even in times of stress, you will not make life-threatening errors.</p>

  <h2 class="subheading" id="importance-of-planning">IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING</h2>

  <p class="noindent top">Detailed prior planning is essential in potential survival situations. Including survival considerations in mission planning will enhance your chances of survival if an emergency occurs. For example, if your job requires that you work in a small, enclosed area that limits what you can carry on your person, plan where you can put your rucksack or your load-bearing equipment (LBE). <b>Put it where it will not prevent you from getting out of the area quickly, yet where it is readily accessible.</b></p>

  <p class="noindent top">One important aspect of prior planning is preventive medicine. Ensuring that you have no dental problems and that your immunizations are current will help you avoid potential dental or health problems. Some dental problems can progress to the point that you may not be able to eat enough to survive. Failure to keep your shots current may mean your body is not immune to diseases that are prevalent in the area.</p>
