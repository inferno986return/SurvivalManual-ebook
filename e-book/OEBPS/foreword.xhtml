	<p class="noindent top">This is an effort to make Ligi's survival manual available as a both a PDF and an ePub, with the ultimate intention of being printable. A printed survival manual would be more practical because it does not require power. It is also unlikely to abruptly fail, which can happen to electronic devices such as a smartphone, tablet or e-reader.</p>

	<p class="noindent top">I have included all the content from Ligi's survival manual wiki as of last edit on the 23rd July 2018. I want to maintain parity as the source gets updated with new or amended information, so do let me know if I am missing anything.</p>

	<p class="noindent top">My own inspiration for this printed guide is the 2014 edition of the "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0007595867">SAS Survival Handbook: The Definitive Survival Guide</a>" (ISBN: 978-0007595860) by John 'Lofty' Wiseman, a former SAS member and survival expert. In the preface the author explains is the importance of three key aspects neccessary for survival which are the skills you have learnt, the equipment you have (kit) and the will to live. This demonstrates the importance of having the correct mindset in a life or death situation.</p>
	
	<p>The SAS Survival Guide is also useful for effective typesetting. I like the use of grey boxes for showing important information and the circular icons on the contents page.</p>
