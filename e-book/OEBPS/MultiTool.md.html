<blockquote>
<p>A MultiTool can be useful in everyday life - not only in survival situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-does-it-provide">What does it provide</h2>
<p>It can provide a lot of tools - hence the name. There are different options available. It is always a tradeoff between weight/size and the amount/set of tools. The common available tools in a typical MultiTool are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knife</li>
<li>Can-Opener</li>
<li>Screw-Driver</li>
<li>Pliers / Pinchers</li>
<li>Wire-Cutter</li>
<li>Wood-Saw</li>
<li>â€¦</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also special tools like: bit-drivers, whistle, scissors, Ferrocerium Rod to spark a fire, Sharpener, ..</p>
<p>If you use a Multi-Tool in every-day life, then you know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you are faster and the confidence you have in your tool can decide between life and death.</p>
<h2 id="which-multitool">Which MultiTool</h2>
<h3 id="leatherman">Leatherman</h3>
<p>There are a lot of options out there. I really like my <a href="OHTMultiTool">Leatherman OHT</a>. I am carrying it most of the time when going out.</p>
<p>Basically just leave it at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security which might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife. At some point I might buy a <a href="TreadMultiTool">Tread Bracelet MultiTool</a> for these cases.</p>
<p>Also I like the story behind the company. There is a nice video with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwyIF4VBTk">inventor on youtube</a>. He wanted this tool and persisted in a very humble way. He is also proudly showing the durability in this video - really worth a look if you still have internet ;-)</p>
<h3 id="victorinox">Victorinox</h3>
<p>Another option is Victorinox, the swiss provider of the Swiss Army Knife (along with Swiss owned Wenger company). With less diversity in the model shapes - two in fact, straight or ergonomic. Victorinox offers a serious selection of embeddable tools. One Recommendation is the SwissTool Spirit (the ergonomic one).</p>
