  <div class="greybox">
    <p class="noindent">A Multi-Tool (or penknife) can be useful in everyday life – not only in survival situations.</p>
  </div>

  <h1 id="what-does-it-provide" class="subheading">What does a Multi-Tool provide?</h1>

  <p class="noindent top">A Multi-Tool can provide a lot of tools – hence the name. There are different options available. It is always a tradeoff between weight/size and the amount/set of tools. The commonly available tools in a typical Multi-Tool are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Knife</li>
    <li>Can-Opener / Corkscrew</li>
    <li>Screwdriver</li>
    <li>Pliers / Tweezers</li>
    <li>Wire-Cutter</li>
    <li>Wood-Saw</li>
    <li>…</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="noindent top">But there are also special tools like: bit-drivers, whistle, scissors, Ferrocerium Rod to spark a fire, Sharpener, ..</p>

  <p class="noindent top">If you use a Multi-Tool in everyday life, then you will know how to use it in a survival situation. The speed in which you can use tool, and the confidence you have with it will be a decision between life and death.</p>

  <h1 id="which-Multi-Tool" class="subheading">Which Multi-Tool should I use?</h1>

  <h2 id="leatherman" class="subheading">Leatherman</h2>

  <p class="noindent top">There are a lot of options out there. I really like my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BETYQG0">Leatherman OHT</a>. Most of the time I carry it when I go out.</p>

  <p class="noindent top">I leave my Leatherman OHT at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security that might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife. At some point I might buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018IOXXP8">Tread Bracelet Multi-Tool</a> for these cases.</p>

  <p class="noindent top">Also, I like the story behind the company. There is a nice video with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwyIF4VBTk">inventor on YouTube</a>. He wanted this tool and persisted in a very humble way. He is also proudly showing the durability in this video – really worth a look if you still have internet ;-)</p>

  <h2 id="victorinox" class="subheading">Victorinox</h2>

  <p class="noindent top">Another option is Victorinox, the Swiss provider of the Swiss Army Knife (along with being a Swiss-owned Wenger company).</p>
  
  <p class="noindent top">With less diversity in the model shapes – two in fact, straight or ergonomic. Victorinox offers a serious selection of embeddable tools. One recommendation is the SwissTool Spirit (the ergonomic one).</p>
