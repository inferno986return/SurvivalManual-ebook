> A MultiTool can be useful in everyday life - not only in survival situations.

## What does it provide

It can provide a lot of tools - hence the name. There are different options available. It is always a tradeoff between weight/size and the amount/set of tools.
The common available tools in a typical MultiTool are:

* Knife
* Can-Opener
* Screw-Driver
* Pliers / Pinchers
* Wire-Cutter
* Wood-Saw
* ...

But there are also special tools like: bit-drivers, whistle, scissors, Ferrocerium Rod to spark a fire, Sharpener, ..

If you use a Multi-Tool in every-day life, then you know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you are faster and the confidence you have in your tool can decide between life and death.

## Which MultiTool

### Leatherman

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT](OHTMultiTool).
I am carrying it most of the time when going out.

Basically just leave it at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security which might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife. At some point I might buy a [Tread Bracelet MultiTool](TreadMultiTool) for these cases.

Also I like the story behind the company. There is a nice video with the [inventor on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwyIF4VBTk). He wanted this tool and persisted in a very humble way. He is also proudly showing the durability in this video - really worth a look if you still have internet ;-)

### Victorinox

Another option is Victorinox, the swiss provider of the Swiss Army Knife (along with Swiss owned Wenger company). With less diversity in the model shapes - two in fact, straight or ergonomic. Victorinox offers a serious selection of embeddable tools. One Recommendation is the SwissTool Spirit (the ergonomic one).
