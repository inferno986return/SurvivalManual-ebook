I have started this project by adding the wiki folder where I have used git clone to copy across the contents of the wiki. The wiki was last edited on the 3rd July 2018.

The app itself is licenced under GNU GPLv3.

The content looks to be licenced under a BSD-style licence, though I need to get this clarified by the original developer.
